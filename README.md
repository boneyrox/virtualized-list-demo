# Virtualized List Performance Demo

A React-based demonstration comparing the performance between a virtualized list using `react-window` and a normal list implementation. This project showcases the benefits of list virtualization for handling large datasets efficiently.

## 🚀 Features

- **List Virtualization**: Efficient rendering of large lists using `react-window`
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time monitoring of:
  - Initial render time
  - Scroll performance
  - Frame rate analysis
  - Dropped frames detection
- **Complex Item Rendering**: Demonstrates performance with rich content items
- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Direct comparison between virtualized and normal lists

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React 18+**
- **TypeScript**
- **react-window**: For efficient list virtualization
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling
- **Next.js**: For application framework

## 📊 Performance Metrics

The demo includes comprehensive performance monitoring:

- **Initial Render Time**: Measures the time taken for first render
- **Scroll Performance**:
  - Average frame time
  - Number of dropped frames
  - Scroll to bottom timing
- **Visual Indicators**:
  - Poor performance warnings
  - Jank detection
